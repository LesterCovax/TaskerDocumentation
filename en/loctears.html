<H2>Detail Comparison</H2>

<A NAME="cell"/>
<H3>State: Cell Near</H3>

<H5>Setup</H5>

Create a <B>state context</B>, select <B>Phone</B> then <B>Cell Near</B>. Click Update and walk around a bit to scan for cell towers nearby.

<H5>About</H5>

Uses information about the cell towers the phone uses for telephony to record and match a location.

<P>
When the display is off, frequency of checks is controlled by <CODE>Prefs / Monitor / Display Off All Checks</CODE>.
</P>
<P>If your profile keeps deactivating, go back to the Cell Near state and click the magnifying glass icon to check
for cells you may have missed in your scan.
</P>

<H5>Plus / Minus</H5>

<UL>
	<LI>(+) virtually no extra power on top of power needed for normal phone service
	<LI>(+) when the display is on, context updates as soon as the tower is visible
	<LI>(+) when the display is off, only one check period is needed to determine context exit
	<LI>(-) highly inaccurate
	<LI>(-) must be physically at the location in order to record it
</UL>

<H5>Other Settings</H5>

<UL>
	<LI><CODE>Monitor / General Monitoring / Use New Cell API</CODE>: if you're not seeing any cells at all when scanning on a modern device, try checking this
	<LI><CODE>Monitor / Display Off Monitoring / Cell Workaround</CODE>: if things aren't working when the display is off
	<LI><CODE>Monitor / Display Off Monitoring / Cell Wake Screen</CODE>: second possible workaround when the display is off
</UL>

<A NAME="btnear"/>
<H3>State: BT Near</H3>

<H5>Setup</H5>

Create a <B>State context</B>, click <B>BT Near</B> (in the Net category), fill in the name or address of a bluetooth device near the location you want to identify.

<H5>About</H5>

<P>
BT Near does regular bluetooth Scans and will activate when it recognizes a device  you have configured
is nearby. Note: you don't have to connect to the device, so it doesn't have to be a device you own.
</P>

<P>
Frequency of checks is controlled by <CODE>Prefs / Monitor / BT Scan Seconds</CODE> (screen on) and <CODE>Prefs / Monitor / Display Off All Checks</CODE> (screen off).
</P>

<P>
Check the <B>BT Toggle</B> box if you don't want bluetooth enabled all the time. It will then be toggled when Tasker needs to do a scan.
</P>

<P>
If your target device is a low-energy device, deselect <B>Standard Devices</B> to reduce energy usage. If you can pair with the target device, you can have a major reduction in power usage and scan times by not selecting <B>Non-Paired Devices</B>.
</P>

<H5>Plus / Minus</H5>

<UL>
    	<LI>(+) very good accuracy, reliability
	<LI>(+) modest power usage, especially for paired devices
     	<LI>(+) works indoors too
     	<LI>(-) need a known device nearby
</UL>

<H5>Other Settings</H5>

<UL>
	<LI><CODE>Prefs / Monitor / Display Off Monitoring / Motion Detection</CODE>: if available on your device, will need to be disabled if you wish to detect a nearby BT device that may move or turn off or on
</UL>

<A NAME="net"/>
<H3>Location: Net</H3>

<H5>Setup</H5>

Create a location context, and deselect GPS.

<H5>About</H5>

<P>
Net location accuracy varies greatly. It's <B>very important</B> that you create a <b>large radius</b> around
the spot you wish to detect.
</P>
<P>
Frequency of checks is controlled by <CODE>Prefs / Monitor / Network Location Check</CODE> (screen on)
and <CODE>Prefs / Monitor / Display Off All Checks</CODE>.
</P>

<A HREF="loccontext.html">More Info</A>.

<H5>Plus / Minus</H5>

<UL>
	<LI>(+) extremely low (extra) power (IF network is available anyway)</LI>
	<LI>(-) requires network and phone service</LI>
	<LI>(-) highly inaccurate and variable fixes</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="netwifi"/>
<H3>Location: Net &amp; Wifi</H3>

<H5>Setup</H5>

Create a location context and deselect GPS. Make sure your device's Wifi is turned on
when you want a more accurate location fix.

<H5>About</H5>
<P>
Net location can be assisted by nearby access points when Wifi is turned on (Google has
a map of APs for many areas).
</P>

<P>Turn Wifi off when not needed to conserve power e.g. use a Time context to turn wifi off at night.</P>
<H5>Plus / Minus</H5>

<UL>
    <LI>(+) very good accuracy in built-up areas for relatively low power usage
   	<LI>(-) must be physically at the location in order to record it
</UL>

<A NAME="near"/>
<H3>State: Wifi Near</H3>

<H5>Setup</H5>

Create a <B>State context</B>, click <B>Wifi Near</B> (in the Net category), fill in the SSID of an Access Point (AP)
with the best signal near where you want to identify.

<H5>About</H5>

<P>
Wifi Near does regular Wifi Scans and will activate when it recognizes an AP you have configured
is nearby. Note: you don't have to connect to the AP. You could configure e.g. the neighbours AP
if the signal is strong enough.
</P>


<P>
Frequency of checks is controlled by <CODE>Prefs / Monitor / Wifi Scan Seconds</CODE> (screen on) and <CODE>Prefs / Monitor / Display Off All Checks</CODE> (screen off).
</P>

<P>
Check the <B>Wifi Toggle</B> box if you don't want wifi on all the time. It will then be toggled when Tasker needs to do a scan. This isn't needed in
In Android 4.4+ if you select <CODE>Scanning Always Available</CODE> in Advanced Wifi Settings and will save power.
</P>


<H5>Plus / Minus</H5>

<UL>
    	<LI>(+) very good accuracy and reliability
     	<LI>(+) less power than GPS
     	<LI>(+) works indoors too
     	<LI>(-) need an AP nearby
</UL>


<H5>Other Settings</H5>

<UL>
	<LI><CODE>Prefs / Monitor / Display Off Monitoring / Motion Detection</CODE>: if available on your device, will need to be disabled if you wish to detect an AP
that may turn off and on.
	<LI>Android location settings: basic location needs to be enabled for Android 8.1+.
</UL>

<A NAME="gps"/>
<H5>Location: GPS</H5>

<H5>Setup</H5>

Create a location context, and deselect Net.

<H5>About</H5>

<P>
Frequency of GPS checks is controlled by <CODE>Prefs / Monitor / GPS Check</CODE> (screen on)
and <CODE>Prefs / Monitor / Display Off All Checks</CODE>. Higher frequencies mean
more battery usage but that location changes will be noticed more quickly.
</P>

<P>
When indoors, GPS will try a long time to get a signal, using a lot of battery. Adjust
it at <CODE>Prefs / Monitor / GPS Timeout</CODE>. Make the
timeout as low as you can until you start losing effectiveness.
</P>


<A HREF="loccontext.html">More Info</A>.

<H5>Plus / Minus</H5>

<UL>
	<LI>(+) highly accurate in the open air</LI>
	<LI>(-) functions very poorly or not at all indoors. A bad side effect is that if you enter a building e.g. office while between the check times, it may never detect 
your new location until you leave.
	<LI>(-) extreme power usage
	<LI>(-) needs network to get a first fix
</UL>

<H5>Other Settings</H5>

<UL>
	<LI><CODE>Prefs / Monitor / Display Off Monitoring / Motion Detection</CODE>: if available on your device, will need to be disabled if you wish to detect changes of location
on the order of a few meters.
</UL>

<A NAME="adv" />
<H3>Advanced Strategies</H3>

<H5>Motion Detection</H5>

<P>
Some devices have a low-power accelerometer that can be active while the rest of
the device is sleeping.
</P>

<P>
For such devices, Tasker will not do location checks with the display off unless
it detects that significant movement has taken place since the last check, resulting
in lower power usage and faster response times when the device does eventually move.
</P>

<H5>Multiple Contexts</H5>

Tasker does not check high-power contexts until all lower-power contexts in the same profile are active.
You can use this to reduce power consumption. For instance, if you use the Wifi Near state to 
detect coming home, you could add a Location: Net context to the same profile, so that wifi scanning
will only take place when you are in the right neighbourhood.

<H5>Location Control</H5>

Disable GPS/Net location when they're not needed by creating a separate profile with e.g. a Time context which disables GPS during the night.

<P>
This works because Location contexts assume you are in the same location until there is a fix which says otherwise.
</P>
