	Location Context
	<IMG style="float:right" SRC="icon_tasker.png"/>
</H2>

<P>
A <I>location context</I> specifies a circular geographical area in which
it is active. It is formed by a centre point (<I>latitude, longitude</I>) plus
a <I>radius</I> around that point.
</P>

<H4>Location Providers</H4>

A location provider is a method of supplying geographical coordinates. Tasker must
use one or more location providers to be able to decide when a location context
should become active or inactive.

<A NAME="gps"/>
<H5>GPS</H5>

<P>
The most accurate provider available (around +-10m), but its performance degrades quickly
indoors and it uses a relatively large amount of power. 
</P>
<P>
To set the frequency of GPS fixes, see <CODE>Menu / Preferences / Monitor</CODE>.
<I>GPS Check Time</I> determines the check frequency in seconds while the device
is awake, <I>Off Check Time</I> while the device is asleep.
</P>
<P>
GPS will only be used for a particular context if it is specified in the location
edit screen.
</P>

<A NAME="net"/>
<H5>Network</H5>

This provider uses a combination of cell-towers
and WiFi information (if wifi is enabled) to determine the device's geographical location. It is
less power-hungry than GPS, but also less accurate (sometimes +- several kilometres)
 and requires data network availability.
<P>
Network will only be used for a particular context if it is specified in the location
edit screen.
</P>
