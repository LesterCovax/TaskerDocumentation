</H2>

<P>
Tasker includes basic support for interacting with a (single) musical instrument which support the MIDI protocol.
</P>

<P>You don't need to know anything about MIDI in order to play complex
tunes on an instrument via Tasker.
</P>

<H3>Requirements and Setup</H3>

<P>The Android ROM on the Android device must support the USB Host protocol.
</P>

<P>
A USB OTG (<I>On The Go</I>) adapter is required for the Android device.
</P>

<P>
If the MIDI device has a USB-To-Host connecter, a normal USB lead can then be used from the
OTG adapter to the MIDI device.
</P>

<P>
If the MIDI device has only MIDI inputs, a USB-To-MIDI adapter must be used from the OTG adapter
to the MIDI device.
</P>

<P>
When a connection has been established with the MIDI device, Android should ask whether permission
should be granted to Tasker to use the device. In order to make things easier and allow automation
without user-interaction, it's recommended that <B>Always</B> be selected.
</P>

<H3>Action: MIDI Play</H3>

Tasker supports playing of notes in various voices and on multiple channels via the <I>MIDI Play</I> action in the <I>Media</I> category.

<P>
The <I>Score</I> parameter in the <I>MIDI Play</I> action uses a Tasker-specific format to hopefully allow even non-musicians to easily 'code' some music.
</P>

<H4>Examples:</H4>

<UL>
	<LI><CODE>C</CODE><BR>
	plays a single C note and stops

	<LI><CODE>D D</CODE><BR>
	plays a D twice

	<LI><CODE>D . . C</CODE><BR>
	plays a D, wait 2 beats, then plays a C

	<LI><CODE>CDA#</CODE> <B><I>or</I></B> <CODE>C,D,A#</CODE><BR>
	plays a C, D and A# simultaneously

	<LI><CODE>D!10</CODE><BR>
	plays a D very softly

	<LI><CODE>D!10 !100,C C C</CODE><BR>
	plays a D very softly then a few loud Cs

	<LI><CODE>C2 C3 C4</CODE><BR>
	Plays three Cs of increasing octaves (higher pitch)

	<LI><CODE>D*4</CODE><BR>
	plays a D for 4 beats

	<LI><CODE>C#/4</CODE><BR>
	plays a C for a quarter beat

	<LI><CODE>C#/4D</CODE><BR>
	plays a C for a quarter beat and simultaneously a D for a full beat

	<LI><CODE>@1 C C C</CODE><BR>

	an E on the second channel with voice 2.

	<LI><CODE>C A<BR><BR>B D</CODE><BR>
	Plays C A B D on channel zero. Note that just starting a new line
	would mean creating a new channel.

	<LI><CODE>C A<BR>A B<BR><BR>B D<BR>C D</CODE><BR>
	Plays C A B D on channel 0 while playing simultauously
	A B C D on channel 1.
</UL>

<H4>Note Specification</H4>

A note specification can be made up of several parts indicating different things about what and how to play. The note itself must be the first part, all other
parts are optional.

<H6>The Note</H6>

Possible notes for the English locale are <CODE>C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B</CODE>. These represent the notes
starting at <I>middle C</I> on a piano, which are in the 4th octave. Flat
notes are also possible e.g. <CODE>D_</CODE>.

<P>
Deeper notes can be achieved
by specifying a lower octave e.g. <CODE>E2</CODE> or <CODE>A#3</CODE> and higher notes a higher octave
e.g. <CODE>C6</CODE>.
</P>

<P>For convenience, lower case versions of the notes are an octave
deeper than the upper case versions e.g. <CODE>c</CODE> is equivalent
to <CODE>C3</CODE>.
</P>

<P>Other locales may have different note naming conventions.</P>

<H6>Note Duration (Optional)</H6>

A note is by default held for one beat. A <CODE>*</CODE> indicates the
note should be held longer e.g. <CODE>C*6</CODE> holds a C for 6 beats.
A <CODE>/</CODE> indicates the note should be shorter e.g. <CODE>C/2</CODE>
indicates that the note should be played for half a beat.

<H6>Note Velocity</H6>

<I>Velocity</I> usually indicates to a MIDI instrument how hard to play the note. It's represented in Tasker via an
exclamation mark e.g. <CODE>!6</CODE> means 'play this note with velocity 6'.

<P>The lowest value is 0 and the highest 127.</P>

<H6>Note Voice</H6>

<I>Voice</I> specifies which instrument to play a note with. It's represented in Tasker by an @ sign
e.g. <CODE>C@1</CODE> 'play a C using voice 1'.

<P>
The voice can be from 0 to 127.
</P>

<P>
Most MIDI instruments don't have more than 128 voices and so you 
probably don't need to read any further in this section.
</P>

<P>However, if your instrument has more voices you will probably
need to specify them using the values <I>MSB</I> and/or <I>LSB</I>
which you will need to find in the instrument's user manual.
<P>

<P>
Tasker allows specificaton of LSB and Program
(the name of the basic parameter) together e.g: <CODE>B@3.1</CODE>
specifies LSB 3 and Program 1.
</P>
<P>
To specify an MSB also, add it on the left e.g. <CODE>D@6.5.3</CODE>
specifies MSB 6, LSB 5 and Program 3.

<H4>Chords</H4>

Several notes can be played at the same time by grouping them
together (no whitespace) or separating them with 
commas e.g. C,D</CODE> and <CODE>CD</CODE> both play a C and a D.

<H4>Channels and Beats</H4>

A specification of a single note or chord is called a beat.

<P>
A channel consists of a set of beats separated by whitespace which are dealt with one-by-one at the same time as the corresponding
beats on other channels. In that way, it's possible to see which notes are going to be played simultaneously.
</P>

<P>Beats usually consist purely of a few notes, but they can also
specify default values of velocity and voice for the channel.
</P>

<P>
For example, <CODE>!10,C D E!100 F</CODE> will play a quiet C,
a quiet D, a loud E then a quiet F. <CODE>@2 C D E@3 F</CODE> plays a C then a D in voice 2, an E in voice 3, then an F in voice 2 again.
</P>

<P>When you reach the end of a line with a channel, do <B>not</B> go
further on the next line. If you do so, the next line will be treated
as a new channel. Instead, leave a blank line.
<BR>
See the last two examples above.

<P>
A dash character <CODE>-</CODE> as the  <B>whole</B> beat means 'do nothing this beat'. 
</P>

<P>
A dash followed by a number will rest for that number of beats. This will mess
up the channel alignment, but can be useful for channel which isn't used
very often.
</P>

<H4>Bars</H4>

A bar is a character that divides music into pieces of equal length. 
Tasker totally ignores <CODE>|</CODE> characters so they do not
count as a beat.

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>
The remainder of a line can be ignored by inserting a single quotation character '.
The line before the quotation mark, and subsequent lines, are unaffected.
<P>

<P>
The rest of a whole channel can be ignored by inserting a double quotation mark ".
The line before the quotation marks are unaffected.
</P>

<P>
Comments can be useful for testing specific parts of a score independently.
</P>

<H4>Variable Support</H4>

<P>
The <CODE>Score</CODE> parameter supports variable just like most other
places in Tasker.
</P>

<P> That means you can e.g. specify a voice specification
with Variable Set and then use the name to make it easier to read
the music e.g. <CODE>@%piano,C @%guitar,D</CODE> (play a C
with piano then a D with guitar: assuming you've first set
the variables to a voice which matches their name on your
MIDI instrument)
</P>

<P>
You can also define variables with sequences of notes and then
define a song as being repeating names e.g. <CODE>%intro %verse %chorus %verse %end</CODE>.
</P>

<H4>Music 'Programming'</H4>

MIDI Play actions can of course be interspersed with other Tasker actions
so that you can do things like loops which play a piece of music at different
pitch levels, loudness, speed etc Here's a task which plays a long chord
with 10 different instrument and each instrument at 5 different velocities
(loudness levels).

<PRE><CODE>
For, %loudness, 20:100:20
For, %voice, 1:10
MIDI Play, @%voice,!%loudness C,E,G
</CODE></PRE>
