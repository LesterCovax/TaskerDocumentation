<BODY>
<H2>
	Run Log
	<IMG style="float:right" SRC="icon_tasker.png"/>
</H2>

<P>
The <i>Run Log</i> shows profile status changes and task/action execution to help when things aren't working as expected.
Log entries will only be recorded when the log is enabled by the switch in the top right.
</P>

<P>
Items are colour-coded according to what they refer to:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI><FONT COLOR="purple">purple</FONT>: a task
	<LI><FONT COLOR="orange">orange</FONT>: a profile
	<LI><FONT COLOR="blue">light blue</FONT>: an action
	<LI>black/white: the monitor or execution service
</UL>

<P>
Most items are long-clickable for options e.g. to view the corresponding item from the user configuration.
</P>

<H3>Details Column</H3>

<P>
Displays the thing which the entry refers to. For example, <CODE>MyTask.Wait</CODE> refers to a <I>Wait</I> action in
the task <I>MyTask</I>.
</P>

<P>
Some notable details are:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI><CODE>System</CODE> refers to a task created by Tasker, usually to restore a <A HREF="settings.html">setting</A>
when a profile deactivates.
	<LI><CODE>Anon</CODE> refers to an <I>anonymous</I> task (has no name) which is the entry or exit task of
a profile.
	<LI>actions with a variable paramater show (after the action name) what the value of the variable was <B>after</B> the action has completed
</UL>

<H3>ID Column</H3>

<P>
Shows Tasker's internal ID for the thing which the entry refers to. This is most useful for actions e.g.
<CODE>2.4</CODE> refers to the fourth action in the task with ID 2.
</P>
<P>
Some task or action ID entries may also have a number after a colon; since multiple copies
of a particular task can run at the same time, each task also receives
a unique <I>execution</I> ID to distinguish it from others with the same
<I>data</I> ID. The execution ID is shown with a colon e.g. a task with ID<CODE>2:3</CODE> is the task with data ID 2 and execution ID 3.
</P>
<P>
Usually, the execution service will start up, run a task and then stop, so
most tasks have execution ID 1. The Run Log doesn't show the execution ID
in that case.
</P>

<H3>Status Column</H3>

<P>
Describes the new status of whatever has changed which caused a log entry to be made. A status which is erronous (a problem occured) is displayed in <FONT COLOR="red">red</FONT> text.
</P>

<H5>Services</H5>
<UL>
	<LI><I>Start</I><BR>the service has started. Unexpected <I>Start</I> entries for the Monitor service are usually caused by Android killing the service because the <CODE>Run In Foreground</CODE> has been disabled in Tasker's Monitor preferences
	<LI><I>Stop</I><BR>the service has stopped
	<LI><I>Restart</I><BR>the service was restarted, usually because new data must be loaded due to the user changing the configuration.
</UL>

<H5>Profiles</H5>
<UL>
	<LI><I>Active</I><BR>the profiles conditions were met so it became active
	<LI><I>Inactive</I><BR>the profiles conditions were no longer all met, so became deactivated
	<LI><I>Instant</I><BR>an <A HREF="faq-other.html#instant">instant profile</A> had a momentary activation
</UL>

<H5>Tasks</H5>
<UL>
	<LI><I>RejBad</I><BR>task was rejected because it was malformed task e.g. had no actions
	<LI><I>RejCopy</I><BR>task was rejected because it's a second copy of a task which has <I>Abort New Task</I> set for <I>Collision Handling</I> in its preferences
	<LI><I>RejMaxQ</I><BR>the maximum number of queued tasks (determined in Action preferences) has been reached
	<LI><I>RejOff</I><BR>Tasker was disabled at the time the task was submitted
	<LI><I>Running</I><BR>the task has been entered in the run queue. Other tasks may still have their actions executed before this one (see <A HREF="tasks.html#scheduling">Task Scheduling</A>)
	<LI><I>ExitErr</I><BR>the task has stopped after an error
	<LI><I>ExitOK</I><BR>the task has finished all its actions and stopped
	<LI><I>ExitRep</I><BR>the task has stopped because a second copy of it has arrived and <I>Abort Existing Task</I> s specified for its <I>Collision Handling</I> preferences
	<LI><I>ExitKill</I><BR>the task has been stopped because the execution service is stopping
</UL>

<H5>Actions</H5>
<UL>
	<LI><I>Disabled</I><BR> the action was disabled via the UI so was skipped
	<LI><I>Err</I><BR> an error occurred while running the action, causing the task to stop
	<LI><I>ErrIgnore</I><BR> an error occurred, but the task could continue (probably because <I>Continue On Error</I> was specified in the action parameters
	<LI><I>Exception</I><BR> a totally unexpected error occurred (things like bugs in Tasker or Android), causing the action to fail and the task to stop
	<LI><I>OK</I>: the action completed OK
</UL>

<H3>Pause/Play Indicator</H3>

The Pause/Play indicator shows whether the list of entries is updating. That's only the case when
the list is at the top i.e. the most recent chronological entries are showing.

<H3>Filter Controls</H3>

<P>
Below the list of log entries are some filter controls.
</P>
<P>Profiles, tasks and action entries are only
shown if the corresponding button is toggled on.
</P>
<P> If a filter text is entered in the text box, entries
will only be displayed if they have text which matches the filter.
</P>

<P>
When an entry is excluded by the filter controls, it's shown as a small bar on the left side of the list.
