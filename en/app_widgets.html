	Task / Shortcut Widgets
	<IMG style="float:right" SRC="icon_tasker.png"/>
</H2>

The standard way of running a Tasker task is by attaching it to a profile
which performs it when the profile becomes active. However, tasks can
be directly assigned to icons on the home screen called <I>Widgets</I> or
<I>Shortcuts</I>.

<H4>Standard Widgets / Shortcuts</H4>

These consist of an icon (the Task icon) with a label (the Task name)
underneath, and look identical to the normal application icons
in the home screen.
<P>
Clicking on the icon runs the associated Task.
</P>

<H4>Task Timer Widgets</H4>

This type consists of an icon and label, like the standard widgets,
but also has a countdown timer display which counts down Days, Hours, 
Minutes and Seconds.
<P>
When the timer expires (reaches 0) the associated Task is run.
</P>
<P>
Tapping on the <B>icon</B> of the widget shows a configuration
screen where the timer can be configured.
</P>
<P>
Tapping on the <B>timer section</B> of the widget will pause,
restart or reset the timer, depending on its current state.
</P>
<P>
Note that the timer updates more rarely when it is still a long
way from expiry in order to minimize  power usage.
</P>

<H4>Creating a Widget / Shortcut</H4>

<OL>
	<LI>Click and hold in an empty space on the Android home screen, until
	a dialog appears.
	<LI>Select <B>Widgets</B> or <B>Shortcuts</B>
	<LI>Select <B>Task</B> or <B>Task Timer</B> (Widgets only)
	<LI>Pick an existing task or create a new one. When creating a new one, if
	you do not expect to change the function of the widget/shortcut select
	One-Time to avoid it cluttering your list of tasks.
	<LI>Use the <A HREF="activity_widget_configure.html">Configuration Screen</A>
	to configure what should happen when the icon is clicked (or the timer
	expires, in the case of a Task Timer widget). Take care to
	select an appropriate name and icon for the task, as these will appear on
	the home screen.
</OL>

<H4>Changing a Widget / Shortcut</H4>

<P>
The function of widgets or shortcuts created from one-time tasks cannot be changed, it must be deleted and recreated.
</P>

<P>
On the other hand, if you associate a normal named task with a widget or shortcut then when the task is changed (via the Task Edit
screen) the function of the widget or shortcut also changes.
</P>

<P>
There are also some actions which will change the appearance of any widget:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI><I>Tasker/Change Icon Set</I>: changes the icon of a set of widgets to a different
	style.
	<LI><I>Tasker/Set Widget Icon</I>: changes the icon of a particular widget
	<LI><I>Tasker/Set Widget Label</I>: changes the label of a particular widget
</UL>

The latter two you could use to visually show the status of something e.g. WiFi.

<H4>Deleting a Widget / Shortcut</H4>

<P>
Click and hold on the icon in the Android home screen until the dustbin
icon appears. Drag the widget or shortcut icon to the dustbin icon and release.
</P>

<H4>Differences Between Widgets and Shortcuts</H4>

<H5>Advantages of Shortcuts</H5>

<UL>
        <LI>they can be created in some places that widgets can't e.g. in home screen folders
        <LI>their layout probably better matches the default launcher layout
        <LI>long shortcut labels will scroll when selected in the default launcher
</UL>

<H5>Advantages of Widgets</H5>

<UL>
        <LI>their icon and label can be dynamically changed after creation
        via the <I>Set Widget Icon</I> and <I>Set Widget Label</I> actions.
        <LI>timer widgets are possible
        <LI>they can be created without a label
</UL>

So a shortcut should be used unless the extra configuration possibilities of a widget are necessary.

<H4>General</H4>	

<UL>
	<LI>you can create as many Tasker widgets and shortcuts as you like. You can even have several Timer widgets running at the same time.
	<LI>Timer Task widgets continue to update even when the screen is off.
</UL>
