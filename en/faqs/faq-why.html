<H4>Why am I an idiot if I use a pirated copy of Tasker ?</H4>

The hacker can do virtually anything with your phone. Record your
calls and upload them to a website, SMS your location and all your
contacts, make calls automatically, wipe your SD card, secretely
record from your microphone any time etc etc

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME="a"/>
<H4>Why is GPS often scanning when I unlock my device ?</H4>

When the device wakes up, Tasker switches from a low-frequency GPS check schedule to a
higher-frequency one. Android's GPS software always does an immediate scan when
switching the check frequency.

<P>
It's not because Tasker is constantly scanning while the device is off
</P>

<P>
You can change the frequency in Menu / Prefs / Monitor.
</P>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<A NAME="b"/>
<H4>Why does Tasker need so many permissions ?</H4>

Because it can do so much!

<P>
Unfortunately, Android requires that an app specify it's permissions even if they are
never used, which means that permissions for all of the things which the user could
<B>potentially</B> ask Tasker to do need to be specified.
</P>
<P>
If you are still concerned, consider that Tasker has over 25,000 downloads at the time of writing and any abuse taking place would quickly be discovered.
</P>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<A NAME="c"/>
<H4>Why does Tasker need the INTERNET permission ?</H4>

The INTERNET permission is used solely for:

<UL>
	<LI>google maps downloading map data, only for setting up a Location context
	<LI>to carry out HTTP Post/Get actions and other actions that require an Internet connection by their nature
	<LI>to verify the order number, and only until it has been successfully verified
	<LI>to check whether a new Tasker version is available, if configured in Preferences
</UL>

<P>
Tasker never directly uses Internet access for <B>anything</B> else.
</P>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<A NAME="d"/>
<H4>Why isn't Tasker shown in the Application Context list ?</H4>

Because it's easy to get into trouble firing tasks in Tasker. For example, if 
a profile is setup with a Tasker Application Context and a task with Load App Calculator,
it will not be possible to enter Tasker anymore.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<A NAME="e"/>
<H4>Why does Tasker have it's own music player <B>and</B> controls for the system music player ?</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>the system music player is not guaranteed to be present or the same on all systems.
	<LI>finer control can be exercised over the Tasker player e.g. starting the track
	from a preset seek point
	<LI>Tasker's player is more discrete, there is no notification bar icon.
	<LI>by having two players available you can do things like alternating audio from different
	music sources or even playing simiultaneously.
</UL>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<A NAME="g"/>
<H4>Why does a Cell Near context not become inactive when I turn on Airplane Mode ?</H4>

Cell Near is <I>sticky</I>. That means that once active it stays active until a non-matching
Cell ID is seen. In Airplane Mode no Cell IDs are seen and so the context stays active.

<P>
Many people use Airplane Mode at night e.g. to save battery. If you also have a Cell Near
profile that detects when you are home, it would become inactive at night if Cell Near wasn't
sticky.
</P>
A couple of points:
<UL>
	<LI>the Cell radio isn't being turned on by Tasker in Airplane Mode.
	<LI>if you want a profile to become inactive for Airplane Mode, just add an Inverted
	state Airplane Mode to it.
</UL>
<P>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME="h"/>
<H4>Why can't I use a downloaded icon for my shortcut task / <CODE>Notify</CODE> action ?</H4>

Some things just weren't meant to be (i.e. Android doesn't allow it).
<P>
To solve the shortcut problem, you can always use a widget though.
</P>

<P>
For notifications:
<UL>
<LI>if you would like this to be possible one day, please star this
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=12302">Android feature request</A>
<LI>it would be technically possible to create 'icon pack' APKs and that might happen one day
</UL>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME="i"/>
<H4>Why does my profile have 2 enter tasks ? Why can't I add an exit task ?</H4>

That's because it's an <A HREF="faq-other.html#instant">instant</A> profile.

<P>
As a convenience, the Exit task with such profiles is replaced by an extra Enter task in case
you have a lot to do with that profile.
</P>

<P>
Note that the tasks you specify execute in the order they are specified, their actions
do not alternate.
