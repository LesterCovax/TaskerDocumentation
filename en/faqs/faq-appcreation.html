<A NAME="c"/>
<H4>Does app creation support profiles and scenes ?</H4>

<P>
Sure. You can export projects as apps and projects can contain
profiles, tasks and scenes.
</P>
<P>
For help accessing projects, see <CODE>Menu / Info / Help This Screen</CODE>
in the main screen.
</P>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<A NAME="a"/>
<H4>Why is the app always shown as running ?</H4>

<P>
Tasker tries to detect when it's monitor service is no longer needed but that is
not always possible. You can put a <CODE>Disable</CODE> action from the <CODE>Tasker</CODE>
category at the end of your launch task to ensure that it happens.
</P>

<P>
The monitor will be started again automatically each time the app is lauched from the home
screen.
</P>


<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME="b"/>
<H4>How do I do initialization on the first launch ?</H4>

Setup your launch task something like this:

<PRE><CODE>
If %LaunchCount = 0
   ...initialization actions...
Else
   ...normal actions...
Elsif
Variable Add, %LaunchCount, 1
</CODE></PRE>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME="h"/>
<H4>How can my task tell if it is running in Tasker or a child app ?</H4>

Use the <B>Test App</B> action and select the mode <B>This Package</B>.
<P>
The resulting variable will contain the package identifier you specified in the
App Configuration screen if the task is running in a child app, otherwise
it will contain one of <I>net.dinglisch.android.tasker</I> or <I>net.dinglisch.android.taskerm</I>.
</P>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME="d"/>
<H4>Why isn't my app detecting background events ?</H4>

One possible cause is: when an app has just been installed on Android it is in a 'frozen' state until
there is some user interaction with it (usually clicking the home screen icon
at least once).

<A NAME="e"/>
<H4>How can I send the developer a short-term App Factory log ?</H4>

<UL>
        <LI>download aLogcat, free from Android Market
        <LI>disable Tasker in the main screen bottom-left
        <LI>in the App Config screen, check <I>Advanced Properties</I> and then <I>Debug</I>
        <LI>create and install the new app *twice*
	<LI>launch the new app from the home screen
	<LI>reproduce whatever conditions cause the problem
        <LI>go to aLogCat, click <B>Menu / Pause</B> then <B>Menu / Send</B>
        <LI>the destination email is listed in <B>Menu / Info / User Support</B> in Tasker
        <LI>include at the top a brief description of the problem that the email concerns
</UL>

<P>
Try to make the log as soon as possible after the problem occurs.
</P>

<A NAME="e2"/>
<H4>How can I send the developer a long-term App Factory log ?</H4>

<UL>
        <LI>disable Tasker by long-clicking the icon top-left in the main screen
        <LI>in the App Config screen, check <I>Advanced Properties</I> and then <I>Debug</I>
        <LI>create and install the new app *twice*
	<LI>enable the <B>Storage</B> permission for the app in Android Settings if necessary
	<LI>launch the new app from the home screen
	<LI>reproduce whatever conditions cause the problem
	<LI>send the developer the log files in the directory NAMEOFAPP in the root directory of the SD card
        <LI>the destination email is listed in <B>Menu / Info / User Support</B> in Tasker
        <LI>include at the top a brief description of the problem that the email concerns
</UL>

<P>
Try to make the log as soon as possible after the problem occurs.
</P>

<A NAME="f"/>
 <H4>Can I include Google Play's licencing service in my app ?</H4>

No, this is not possible.
<P>
Tasker's code does not include the licencing service because of continual problems
it caused. In any case, the licensing service is ineffectual for preventing
unauthorized code distribution.
</P>
<P>
If you really want to include licensing in your app, you could e.g. require the
user to enter their order code and check via the <I>HTTP Get</I> action on your
server if that is a valid number.
</P>
<P>
Setting up such a server to download Google order details and accept verification
requests is a lot of effort and requires some technical knowledge, however.
</P>


<!-------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME="g"/>
<H4>Can I get the java source code from my created app ?</H4>

<P>
Short answer: no.
</P>

<P>
Long answer: when a new app is created, Tasker doesn't create new java code to
implement the things in your task or project configuration. Instead, the existing
Tasker code is used with the new app and executed similarly to how it's executed
in Tasker, but in the shell of a new APK.
