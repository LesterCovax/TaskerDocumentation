<HR>
<P>
<B>Note:</B> CPU control can damage your hardware e.g. by the CPU overheating. As for all Tasker
functions, you use it at your own risk!
</P>
<HR>

<H3>General</H3>

<P>
On a rooted device (only) Tasker is able to control the CPU frequency of an Android device to some extent. This
is usually done either to save battery or make the device more responsive depending on the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The relevant control action is <B>CPU</B> in the <B>Misc</B> category.
You can monitor the current state with the variables <B>%CPUFREQ</B> and <B>%CPUGOV</B>.</P>
</P>
<P>There are two aspects which can be controlled, the Frequency Range and the
CPU Governor. You will need to experiment with combinations of these to achieve the best results.</P>

<H3>Frequency Range</H3>

<P>
You can set the minimum and maximum frequency which the CPU is allowed to run at. Only certain frequencies
are valid, depending on the CPU (click on the magnifying glass button to select a valid value).
</P>
<P>
The maximum frequency is probably initially set lower than the maximum frequency that the CPU can actually handle. If that is the case, you should be very cautious about setting it higher. Tasker will warn
you the first time you try to do configure an action to do that, assuming
you have not been using other apps to change the maximum frequency limit.
</P>

<H3>CPU Governor</H3>

<P>
The active <I>governor</I> decides what the CPU frequency should be set to at a particular time, within the frequency
range you have set. Each has it's own unique strategy. Here are the most common governors:

<UL>
	<LI><I>Performance</I><BR/>keeps the CPU frequency always at the maximum. Most power-hungry, most responsive.<P/>
	
	<LI><I>Powersave</I><BR/>keeps the CPU frequency always at the minimum. Least power-hungry, least responsive.<P/>
	<LI><I>Ondemand</I><BR/>when the CPU is needed, immediately sets it to maximum frequency. Slowly reduces the
	frequency back down to the minimum as time passes. Responsive, reasonable power usage.<P/>
	<LI><I>Interactive</I><BR/>like Ondemand, but more responsive with slightly more battery usage.<P/>
	<LI><I>Conservative</I><BR/>when the CPU load is needed, slowly increases the frequency to maximum. When the CPU is
no longer needed, immediately drops back to the minimum. Less power-usage than Ondemand or Interactive, less responsive.
</UL>

<P>
Not all governors are available on all ROM versions. Your device may also have a governor not described here. You can still set that governor with Tasker.
</P>

<H3>CPU Action Not Available</H3>

Common problems are:

<UL>
	<LI><I>root not recognized</I><BR>Tasker decides that a device is rooted if <CODE>/system/app/Superuser.apk</CODE> is present and <CODE>su</CODE> is present in one of the directories of $PATH
	<LI><I>no available frequencies</I><BR>Tasker needs to know what frequencies it can set the CPU to. It looks for the files <CODE>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies, /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state</CODE> and <CODE>/system/etc/scaling_available_frequencies</CODE> (in that order). If you know what your CPU frequencies are, you could write them (space-separated, in numerical order) to the first (any number of CPUs) or last (1 CPU only) of those files.
