<H4>What's A Setting ?</H4>

Settings are actions like <I>Display Brightness</I> and <I>Ringer Volume</I>
whose effects are reversed by Tasker when the profile(s) which applied them 
are no longer active.
<P>
Setting actions have a double arrow icon next to them.
</P>

<H4>Single Profile</H4>

When a setting is applied by the profile's Enter Task, its value is restored
after the profile becomes inactive again. For example, if
the ringer volume is at 7 and is set to 0 in the Enter Task,
when the profile becomes inactive it is automatically set back to 7.
<P>
In other words, settings are only valid for the lifetime of their profiles.
</P>

<H4>Multiple Profiles</H4>

When multiple profiles that affect a setting are active simultaneously:
<OL>
	<LI>the setting has the value from the <B>most recently activated</B> profile
	<LI>when <B>all</B> profiles are inactive, the setting has the value from before
	<B>any</B> profile was active
</OL>

<H4>Special Cases</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>if a setting is changed by the Exit Task the profile will never save the setting's initial value.
	<LI>settings changed in an <I>instant profile</I> (one with an event context or repeating/non-ranged time context)  remain changed after the
	event. The reasoning is that there is no point in changing the setting for the
	half-second that the event lasts.
</UL>
	
<H4>Notes</h4>

<UL>
	<LI>settings are not <I>actively</I> maintained. If something else changes the setting
	once the Enter task has run, it's not the case that this is detected and the
	Enter task value automatically reapplied.
</UL>
Complicated, huh ?
