File type is either <b>file</b> or <b>dir</b>.<br/><br/>Contact lookups are based on the phone number of the contact.<br/><br/>Calendar values require the time in seconds since the epoch as data (e.g. use %TIMES, or use the Variable Convert action to convert a date/time into seconds first) and are entered in an array (%var1, %var2 etc), not a plain value, because there may be multiple events at the time specified.</P></body></html>
