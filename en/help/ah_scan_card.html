This can save a lot of time removing and reinserting the physical card.<br/><br/>If a file is specified, only that file is scanned.<br/>If a directory is specified, all of its contents will be scanned recursively.<br/><br/>Note: repeatedly scanning the same file will not update the thumbnail in Gallery.<br/><br/>On Android 4.4+, scanning the whole card or a directory only picks up *new* files and the task waits till the scan is finished.</P></body></html>
