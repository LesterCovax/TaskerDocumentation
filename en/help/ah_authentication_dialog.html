	<H2>Authentication Dialog</H2>
	<P>Show a dialog that allows the current user to authenticate. This can be used to allow for secure execution of certain tasks.</P>
	<P><b>Read Result To</b> will set the authentication result into both a variable and an array with that variable name:</P>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Variable</b>: Will contain the last authentication result. Can be <b>success</b> or whatever error there was in case of an error. You will probably use this most of the time.</li>
		<li><b>Array</b>: For advanced uses. Will contain all authentication results that resulted from the dialog, ie, if your finger wasn't recognized first but then it was you'll have an array with 2 items: an error and success</li>
	</ul>
	<P>If you want to handle errors use the <b>Continue Task After Error</b> option and check the result variable.</P>
