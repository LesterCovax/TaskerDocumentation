Therefore, for best results when automating, it's recommended to give each alarm a unique label and then use that for cancellation.<br/><br/>If the specified alarm is a repeating alarm, then only the next instance is cancelled (the alarm remains enabled)<br/><br/>Some modes are poorly implemented by many Android devices. For instance, snooze time may be ignored.</P></body></html>
