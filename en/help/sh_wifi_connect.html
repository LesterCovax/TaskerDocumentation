Setting it to <b>Yes</b> means the WiFi must be the default route to the internet. If <b>Yes</b> and you enable VPN, the WiFi state rightfully becomes inactive, as that WiFi connection is only used to route traffic to the VPN. The VPN has default route to internet. Any means it doesn't matter if WiFi is route to internet or not, as long as you are connected to a WiFi.</P></body></html>
