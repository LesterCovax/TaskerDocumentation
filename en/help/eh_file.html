For instance, if you respond to an open event by copying the file make sure you have Abort New Task set in task properties, since the act of copying the file will trigger another open event and an endless loop will occur otherwise.<br/><br/>Limitation: if a file is deleted and recreated, subsequent file events will not be reported.</P></body></html>
