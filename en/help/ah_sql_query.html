The columns within each row are separated by the Output Column Divider.<br/><br/>Null DB values are represented as <null>, BLOBs as <blob>, problems with <???><br/><br/>When making several transactions on a DB on external storage or which needs root to access, it will be much more efficient to first move the DB file to internal storage (Move File action) and operate on it there.<br/><br/>In Raw mode, only the following directives requiring writeable DB access are supported: INSERT INTO, UPDATE, CREATE TABLE, DELETE FROM, ALTER TABLE.</P></body></html>
