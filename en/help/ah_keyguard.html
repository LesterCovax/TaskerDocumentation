There is also the possibility of interference with other applications that manipulate the keyguard.<br/><br/>On Android 2.2+, this action should probably only be used when the device is on and unlocked, unless the unlock method in Android settings is set to None.<br/><br/>Side-effect: coming out of Airplane Mode with Keyguard disabled may leave the SIM unrecognized until Keyguard is toggled again.<br/><br/>See also: action Keyguard Pattern.</P></body></html>
