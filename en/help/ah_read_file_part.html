If unspecified, the record after the previously read one *in that file* is read. A variable is used in place of a number here to permit e.g. reading a random record via the Variable Randomize action.<br/><br/>If the end of the file was reached before the specified record number was found, it will contain the value EOF. The next line number then resets to 1.<br/><br/>Blank lines and any newline character at the end of a file are always ignored.<br/><br/>Don't try to read a non-text file with this, the results will probably be disastrous.<br/><br/>The action is not very efficient for reading all the records in a file, since it starts from the beginning each time.</P></body></html>
