	<H4>NFC Tag</H4>
	<P>Allows you to react to a scanned NFC tag.</P>
	<P>You can react by ID, Content or both. This allows you to react to NFC Tags that you don't write yourself. For example, if you have an old key card lying around that has an NFC chip in it, you can react to it by ID and do your automations that way.</P>
	<P>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3cbS3aez6M">this video example</a> to see this in action.</P>
