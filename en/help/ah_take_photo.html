The current activity will be interrupted for a couple of seconds.<br/><br/>If Discreet is checked, there will be no visible or audible sign of the picture being taken, and the device will not turn on if it is already off (except on Eclair devices).<br/><br/>Without Discreet, a small delay allows time for aiming.<br/><br/>Insert in Gallery: immediately insert a thumbnail in the Gallery application, otherwise it will not appear until the next time the SD card is scanned.<br/><br/>Naming Sequence: Series: photo names have an index number attached which increases with each one taken. Chronological: the date and time is attached to the filename.<br/><br/>Photos are in JPG format and stored in /sdcard/dcim/Tasker/. You should not attach the .jpg affix when specifying the filename prefix.<br/><br/>See also: Menu / Prefs / Action / Camera Delay.</P></body></html>
