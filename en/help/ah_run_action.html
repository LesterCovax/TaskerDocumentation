This is a very useful action to assign to a home screen widget, since it allows you to easily execute any of Tasker's actions without having to set up a profile etc first.<br/><br/>Wait and Wait Until actions cannot be queried. As a workaround, you could query for a variable and then then Wait in the next action of the task using the variable value.</P></body></html>
