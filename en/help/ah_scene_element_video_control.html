For instance, Play is not possible until the video has loaded.<br/><br/>Tip: to simplify a manual load-and-start-video, specify in the element a variable as the source of the video and check Start Automatically. Then instead of using a Video Control action with Load Source, just set the variable.</P></body></html>
