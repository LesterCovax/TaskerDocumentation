Stream specifies a sound channel, File specifies a location on the SD card; the synthesized speech is stored in WAV format.<br/><br/>Network: use network synthesis, if supported by the current engine/voice. This may result in better quality.<br/><br/>Continue Task Immediately: if selected, Tasker will continue with the next queued action while the speech is still ongoing. You must select this in order to do a Shut Up action later.<br/><br/>Android settings may override locale, speed and pitch. Please see the 'Always use my settings option' in Android's Text-To-Speech settings section.<br/><br/>If <i>Reduce Resource Usage</i> in Tasker Prefs / Misc is checked, the speech engine will be shutdown after each utterance, meaning the speech will always begin later for subsequent Say actions.</P></body></html>
