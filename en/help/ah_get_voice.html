It's possible there may be several results because of deficiencies in the speech-recognition or e.g. environmental noise. To get e.g. the first result, use the Variable Split action and then access %VOICE1.<br/><br/>If the recognition fails or the specified Timeout is exceeded, %VOICE is cleared (detect this condition with the Is Set operator).<br/><br/>Language Model is a hint to the speech-recognizer for fine-tuning the results.<br/><br/>The default Android speech recognizer requires a network connection and therefore has a high-latency. Other recognizers are available e.g. on Play Store.<br/><br/>Tip: it may be necessary to install the Google Search app in order to access this action on some devices.</P></body></html>
