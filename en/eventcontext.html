</H2>

An <I>Event Context</I> allows specification of an event
which is needed to activate its profile e.g. SMS received,
screen has gone off.
<P>
Events are a little different to other contexts because they
are <I>instantaneous</I> whereas other contexts usually have
a duration.
</P>
<P>
This means that it is nonsensical to specify that e.g. the
screen brightness should be set to X for the duration of the
event, so Tasker assumes that all <A HREF="settings.html">settings</A>
actions should persist beyond the event.
</P>
<P>
For more information about specifying events, see
the <A HREF="activity_eventedit.html">Event Edit screen</A>.
</P>

<H4>Event Parameters</H4>

When a task is triggered by an event, the parameters of the event that
ocurred are passed to the task so that it can make decisions based
on the event details.
<P>
The parameters are passed in the <A HREF="variables.html#arrays">array</A>
<I>%evtprm</I>.
</P>
<P>
The order of elements of the array have values which match the order
of the parameters of the event.
</P>

<P>Example: if an event's second parameter is an Application, %evtprm2 
in the launched task will be set to the label of the application 
which triggered the event.
