<H2>
	Variables
	<IMG style="float:right" SRC="icon_tasker.png"/>
</H2>

<H4>General</H4>

A variable is a named value which changes over time e.g. the level of the battery, the time of day.

<P>
When Tasker encounters a variable name in a text, it replaces the name with
the current value of the relevant variable before carrying out the action.
</P>
<P>
The main purposes of variables are:

<UL>
	<LI><I>dynamic binding</I>: doing something with an action with data which
</P>
	is unknown when the task is created e.g. respond to an SMS; the sender
	is not known until the SMS is received.
	<LI>allow <A HREF="flowcontrol.html">flow control</A> within and
	between tasks
	<LI>record data for some future use e.g. passing data between tasks
</UL>

<H4>Global vs. Local Variables</H4>

<P>
Variables which have an <B>all-lower-case</B> name (e.g. %fruit_bar) are <I>local</I>, meaning that their value is specific to the task or scene in which they are used.
</P>

</P>
Variables which have one or more capital letters in their name (e.g. %Car, %WIFI) are <I>global</I>, meaning that wherever they
are accessed from the same value is returned.
</P>

<H4>Built-In Variables</H4>

<P>
The values of built-In variables are updated automatically by Tasker.
</P>

<H5>Local Built-In Variables</H5>

<UL>
	<LI><B>Action Error</B><BR>
	<I>%err</I><BR>
	Is set to an integer if an error occurred when running the last action. The actual number
	can signify the error which occurred, but is usually 1 for most Tasker actions (notable
	exception: <CODE>Run Shell</CODE> and plugins). Every action sets or clears it, so it must be saved (e.g. with <a href="https://tasker.joaoapps.com/userguide/en/help/ah_set_variable.html">Variable Set</a>) if it will be needed later than in the immediate next action. 

	<LI><B>Action Error Description</B><BR>
	<I>%errmsg</I><BR>
	A description of the error which <B>last resulted in %err being set</B>. Currently never set by
	Tasker but possibly by some plugin actions.

	<LI><B>Task Priority</B><BR>
	<I>%priority</I><BR>
	The priority of the running task. The priority determines which task
	executes its next action when several tasks are running together.<BR>See
	also: <A HREF="tasks.html#scheduling">Task Scheduling</A>

	<LI><B>Task Queue Time</B><BR>
	<I>%qtime</I><BR>
	How long (seconds) the running task has been running.
	<BR>
        Note that tasks can be interrupted by higher priority tasks, so this number
        is not necessarily the total run-time of the task.

	<BR>
	<LI><B>Task Caller</B><BR>
	<I>%caller</I><BR>
	A variable array tracing the origin of the current running task. <I>%caller1</I> gives the origin
	of the current task, <I>%caller2 </I>the origin of <I>%caller1</I> etc. 
	<P>
	Example: if task A uses action <CODE>Perform Task</CODE> to start task B, then when task A is run by pressing
	the Play button in the task edit screen, <I>%caller1</I> in task B will show <B>task=A</B>, <I>%caller2</I> will show <B>ui</B>.
	<P>
	The format of each entry in the array is <I>callertype</I>(<B>=</B><I>callername</I>(<B>:</B><I>subcallername</I>))
	<P>

	Caller types ares detailed below:
	<UL>
		<LI><B>profile</B><BR>
		a profile (when it's state changes). <I>callername</I> is either <B>enter</B> or <B>exit</B> depending on whether the profile
		activated or deactivated. <I>subcallername</I> is the name of the profile, if it has one, otherwise <B>anon</B>
		<LI><B>scene</B><BR>
		a scene event, with <I>callername</I> being the scene name. For element events, <I>subcallername</I> is the element name. For action bar button presses, <I>subcallername</I> is the label if one was given. For scene-global events (e.g. Key), <I>subcallername</I> is event type 
		<LI><B>ui</B><BR>
		the Play button in the task edit screen in the Tasker UI
		<LI><B>launch</B><BR>
		clicking a child application icon in the launcher
		<LI><B>nbutton</B><BR>
		a notification action button, either from Tasker's permanent notification or one created with one of the Notify actions.
		<I>callername</I> specifies the label of the button if present.
		<LI><B>external</B><BR>
		an external application
		<LI><B>qstile</B><BR>
		a Quick Settings tile. <I>callername</I> specifies the label of the tile.
		<LI><B>appshort</B><BR> 
		an app shortcut (accessed via long-click on the Tasker icon). <I>callername</I> specifies the label of the tile.
		<LI><B>task</B><BR>
		another task, from a Perform Task action. <I>subcallername</I> is the task name, if it has one, otherwise <B>anon</B>

		<LI>Power AMP
		<LI>BeyondPod (Tasker v1.2.1+)
		<LI>Phantom Music Control Pro
		<LI>Media Utilities
	</UL>
	Priority: if both Tasker and one of the other supported apps are playing simultaneously, the
	non-Tasker track will be shown. If more than one of the other supported apps is playing 
	simultaneuosly, behaviour is unspecified.
	<BR>Notes:<UL>

	The title of the last notification shown in the status bar. Prior to KitKat, requires Tasker's accessibility server
	to be running (see Android Accessibility Settings). From KitKat, requires Tasker's Notification Listener service
	to be running instead. 
	<BR>
	In a task running as a result of a <CODE>Notification</CODE> or <CODE>Notification Removed</CODE> event, use variable %evtprm2 instead

<H5>General Notes</H5>

<P>
Variables marked <CODE>dynamic</CODE> in the list above trigger changes in <I>Variable Value</I> states
and <I>Variable Set</I> events whenever their value changes.
</P>

<P>
Variables marked <CODE>monitored</CODE> will cause the relevant monitor to startup to track their state
when they are used in contexts or tasks which are used by widgets or <B>enabled</B> profiles. 
For instance, %CELLID used in a Flash action will cause cell location to be tracked.
</P>
<P>
Limitation: monitored variables cannot be detected in anonymous shortcuts.
</P>

<A NAME="locnote"/>
<H5>Note On Location Variables</H5>

<P>
When the relevant provider (Net or GPS) of a location context is active, these variables report the values from the provider,
which may be more recent than Tasker has seen if other applications are asking for location.
</P>
<P>
When the relevant provider is <B>not</B> active, these variables report the last values <B>seen by Tasker</B>,
which could be the result of a <CODE>Get Location</CODE> action or of monitoring for a <CODE>Location Context</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
That means the the reported fix times could <B>go backwards</B>, if you turn off the location provider
between two uses of the variables.
</P>

<P>
Location variables can also be manually updated by running the <CODE>Get Location</CODE> action.
</P>

<H4>User Variables</H4>

The action <I>Variable Set</I> (and several others) can be used to create new variables. Variable names have the following restrictions:

<UL>
	<LI>they must start with the <B>%</B> character
	<LI>they are case-sensitive
	<LI>then must at least a further <B>3</B> alphanumeric characters
	<LI>they can also contain the underscore character (_) but not start or end with it
</UL>

</P>
<P>In general, it's best to use local variables wherever possible because:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>you know they won't be interfered with by other tasks or scenes
<LI>they are more efficient in several ways
</UL>
<P>
Note: multiple copies of the same task running at the same time each have their own separate copy of their local variables.
</P>

<H6>Scene-Local Variables</H6>

<P>
Each scene has its own set of local variables which it shares with
the task that created it; both the scene and task 
see changes to the variables made by either.
</P>

<P>
Any task which starts as a result of a scene event (e.g. a tap on an element)
also shares the variables of the scene (and thus of the original
task which created the scene).
</P>

<P>
As a consequence, a task started by a scene event (e.g. Tap on an element)
which shows a new scene e.g. via the <I>Show Scene</I> action, will result in
the second scene sharing the variables of the first scene.
</P>

<P>
When a task shows a scene that was created by a different task (or a different copy
of the same task) and subsequently hidden, the task's variables are <B>copied</B> to the scene variables (overriding
values of variables which already exist) but
the task does <B>not share</B> the scene variables and cannot see changes to them.
</P>



<H5>Escaping Variable Names</H5>

If you want to prevent a variable name being replaced, put a <B>\</B> in front of it e.g.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>Variable Set, %new, \%old</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Will set the value of <I>%new</I> to <I>%old</I>, <B>not</B> the <B>value</B> of <I>%old</I>.
<P>In order to precede a variable name with a <B>\</B> you can escape the backslash e.g.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>Variable Set, %new, \\%old</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Will set the value of <I>%new</I> to <B>\</B> followed by the <B>value</B> of <I>%old</I>.

<H5>Variable References</H5>

It's possible to indirectly refer to variables by preceeding one or
more extra <B>%</B> signs to the start of the variable name.
For example:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
Variable Set, %colour, red<BR>
Variable Set, %varname, colour<BR>
Flash %%varname
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
... will flash <B>red</B>.
</P>
<P>
Using this notation it's possible to assign variables whose name is
not known beforehand:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
Read File, variablename.txt, To Var, %varname<BR>
Variable Set, %%varname, red
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This will set the variable whose name is stored in the file <CODE>variablename.txt</CODE> to <B>red</B>.
</P>


<P>
You can nest references as deeply as you like (e.g. <CODE>%%%%var</CODE>)
but mental stress and bugs are sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
If any part of the chain has an invalid variable name then the original
reference will be returned. In the first example, if <CODE>%varname</CODE>
is set to <CODE>!!!</CODE>, then <B>%%varname</B> will be flashed instead
of <B>red</B>.
</P>

<H5>Variable Lifetime</H5>

The value a <B>global</B> variable holds lasts until Tasker is uninstalled if
it is not changed by any task.
<P><B>Local</B> variables are lost at the end of the task they were created in, or
when the parent scene is destroyed in the case of tasks called from scenes.
</P>

<H5>Uninitialized Variables</H5>

<P>
User-variables which have not had a value assigned do not have replacements carried out e.g. in the expression <I>I love %fruit</I>, if
%fruit is uninitialized, the expression remains as it is, otherwise %fruit is replaced with the value.
</P>
<P>
Exception: uninitialized variables used in mathematical expressions are replaced with 0.
</P>

<H4>Variables In Plugins</H4>

Plugin developers can tell Tasker to replace variables
it finds in plugin strings with their current Tasker value. If you have a plugin
which doesn't support this, send the developer this URL

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="http://tasker.dinglisch.net/plugins.html">http://tasker.dinglisch.net/plugins.html</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
which has the relevant details.
</P>

<A NAME="arrays"/>
<H4>Variable Arrays</H4>

Tasker supports pseudo-arrays.
<P>
They are especially useful when used with the <CODE>For</CODE> action, since you can
perform a set of actions on each element in turn e.g. list a set of files then 
test each one.
</P>

<H5>Examples</H5>

<P>
If the four variables <B>%arr1, %arr2, %arr3, %arr4</B> hold respectively <B>a, b, c</B> and <B>d</B>
then we have an array with 4 <I>elements</I>.
These variables can be used just like any other, however it is also possible to access
them in special ways. Here are some examples:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>%arr(#)</B><br>
	The number of defined array elements (<B>4</B> in this case)
	<LI><B>%arr(#>)</B><br>
	The index of the first defined array element, or <B>0</B> if none are defined (<B>1</B>).
	<LI><B>%arr(#<)</B><br>
	The index of the last defined array element, or <B>0</B> if none are defined (<B>4</B>)
	<LI><B>%arr(#?b/c)</B><br>
	A comma-separated list of the array indices (lowest to highest) with matching values, or <B>0</B> if none match (<B>2,3</B> in the example)
	<LI><B>%arr(#?~Rregex here)</B><br>
	Same as above but with regex matching
	<LI><B>%arr(>)</B><br>
	The contents of the first defined array element (<B>a</B>)
	<LI><B>%arr(<)</B><br>
	The contents of the last defined array element (<B>d</B>)
	<LI><B>%arr()</B> or <B>%arr(:)</B><br>
	All of the array elements separated by commas (<B>a,b,c,d</B>)
	<LI><B>%arr(2)</B> or just <B>%arr2</B><br>
	The content of the element with index 2 (<B>b</B>)
	<LI><B>%arr(2:4)</B><br>
	Contents of defined elements with indices 2 to 4 (<B>b,c,d</B>)
	<LI><B>%arr(:3)</B><br>
	All the defined elements with indices up to 3 (<B>a,b,c</B>)
	<LI><B>%arr(3:)</B><br>
	All the defined elements with indices starting from 3 (<B>c,d</B>)
	<LI><B>%arr(1:2)</B><br>
	All the defined elements with indices from 1 to 2 (<B>a,b</B>)
</UL>

Notes:

<UL>
<LI>arrays will virtually always have all their elements defined so e.g. %arr(>) will be the same as %arr(1), %arr(#) will be the same as %arr(#<)
<LI>index specifiers can themselves be variables (e.g. %arr(1:%MAX) or %arr(#?%FINDME)) but <B>not</B> variable arrays
</UL>

<H5>Creating An Array</H5>

<OL>
	<LI>using <CODE>Array Set</CODE>:<BR>
	<b>Array Set, %arr, a b c d</b>
	<LI>using <CODE>Variable Split</CODE> on an existing (simple) variable:<br>
	<B>Variable Set %arr a b c d</B><BR>
	<B>Variable Split %arr</B><BR>
	<LI>by assigning individual elements with <CODE>Variable Set</CODE>:<BR><B>Variable Set, %arr3, c</B>.
	<LI>using <CODE>Array Push</CODE> to add an initial element
	<LI>some other actions also create arrays for their results e.g. <CODE>List Files</CODE>.
</OL>

<H5>Inserting Elements</H5>

Use the <CODE>Array Push</CODE> action.

<P>
The <I>Fill Spaces</I> parameter might need more explanation. It is only relevant if one or more of the array elements are undefined. As an example, if we have the array elements %arr1 and %arr3 containing <B>apple</B> and <B>banana</B>:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Array Push %arr1, 1, pear</B><br>leaves %arr1, %arr2 and %arr4 containing <B>pear</B>, <B>apple</B> and <B>banana</B>.<BR>
<LI>but <B>Array Push %arr2, 1, pear, Fill Spaces</B><BR>leaves %arr1, %arr2 and %arr3 containing <b>pear</B>, <B>apple</B> and <B>banana</B>.
</UL>

<H5>Removing Elements</H5>

<P>
Use the <CODE>Array Pop</CODE> action. Note the difference between <CODE>Array Pop</CODE> and <CODE>Variable Clear</CODE>: 
<CODE>Pop</CODE> reduces the number of elements in the array, while <CODE>Clear</CODE> merely changes elements to undefined.
</P>

<P>
Example: if we have the array elements %arr1, %arr2, %arr3 containing <B>apple</B>,<B>pear</B> and <B>banana</B>:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Variable Clear %arr2</B><br>leaves %arr1 and %arr3 containing <B>apple</B> and <B>banana</B>.<BR>
<LI>but <B>Array Pop %arr2</B><br>leaves %arr1 and %arr2 containing <B>apple</B> and <B>banana</B>.
</UL>

<H5>Deleting An Array</H5>

Use <CODE>Array Clear</CODE>.<P>In most cases you could also use <B>Variable Clear %arr*</B> with Pattern Matching checked,
but that would also delete variables called e.g. %arrTOODEETOO so <CODE>Array Clear</CODE> is safer.</P>

<H5>Sorting</H5>

The <CODE>Array Process</CODE> action offers various sorting options, amongst other things.

<H5>Array Efficiency</H5>

Arrays are intended for convenience when processing high-level data, not for e.g.
processing astronomical data.  Doing thousands of array actions will likely
take several seconds (although mostly due to the housekeeping work done by Tasker
in-between each action rather than due to the array operations themselves).
</P>
<P>
In terms of storage efficiency, they are also fairly hopeless. You probably do not
want to store tens of thousands of items in an array.
