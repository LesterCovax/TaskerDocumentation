This screen allows configuration of an <A HREF="eventcontext.html">Event Context</A>.

<H4>Event Name</H4>

The name of the event is given at the top of the screen.
Clicking on it allows changing to another event type.
<P>
In the top right is a button to show help for the
displayed event type.
<P>

<H4>Priority</H4>

Only present for relevant events.
<P>
Selects the priority at which this event will be detected.
An event can be processed by other Tasker Profiles, other
installed applications and system processes.
</P>
<P>
If priority is high, then this profile will be more likely
to detect the event before other processes, and vice versa.
</P>

<H4>Stop Event</H4>

Only present for relevant events.
<P>
If checked, then once this profile has dealt with the event,
other user or system applications will no longer be able to
see it.
<P>
You can achieve different effects by combining <I>Priority</I>
and <I>Stop Event</I>. For instance, if you want to show a Tasker menu
when the camera button is pressed, you would set <I>Priority</I> <B>High</B>
and check the <I>Stop Flag</I>, because you do not want the 
camera application to appear afterwards.

<H4>Event Parameters</H4>

<P>
Some events have paramaters to specify more details about the event.
To get help on particular parameters, click the question-mark icon
at top right.
</P>

<P>
Text parameters are treated as <A HREF="matching.html">pattern matches</A>.
</P>

<P>
If you would like to make more complex comparions (e.g. mathematical expressions), leave the event parameter
blank and instead put a <A HREF="flowcontrol.html#condition">condition</A> on the first
action of the task you execute with the profile.
