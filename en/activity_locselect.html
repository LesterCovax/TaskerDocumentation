This screen allows configuration of a <A HREF="loccontext.html">Location Context</A>.

<H4>Map Display</H4>

The map shows the location (base of the flag icon), radius and names of all defined location contexts

<P>
The location currently being defined has a yellow base, other location contexts have a blue base.
</P>

<H4>Map Controls</H4>

<UL>
	<LI><B>long-click</B> on the map to select a location for this context.
	<LI><B>long-click then drag</B> on the flag for the current location to drag it
</UL>

<P>
Use the pull-down selector under the map to specify the radius for this context.
</P>
<P>
<B>Important:</B> if your radius is too small compared to the accuracy of
the fixes you are receiving, your context may never go active. If you can't get
a fix, try increasing the radius. Typically, a good radius would be around twice the
accuracy of the fixes you are receiving.
</P>
<P>
If you have no internet available in order to retrieve the map tiles, you can still use
the <B>Get Fix</B> button (see below) to specify your current location.
</P>

<H4>Action Bar Options</H4>

<H5>Grab ('My Location') Button</H5>
<P>
Acquires a location fix using the enabled and available providers (make sure the GPS
Button is clicked first if you want to use GPS).
</P>
<P>
Once a fix is acquired, the latitude, longitude and radius of this location context
are set according to it. If you reduce the radius after a fix, Tasker may no longer
accurately detect whether you are in or out of the context.
</P>
<P>
When trying to determine current location, Tasker will keep going with fixes until they stop improving (e.g. as the
GPS locks on to more satellites). If you get impatient you can press the Get Fix button
again to stop the process (its label is changed to <B>Stop</B> while a fix is being
acquired).
</P>

<H5>Address Menu Item</H5>

Allows entry of an address for which this location context should be active.

<H4>Bottom Buttons</H4>

<H5>Net Button</H5>

The Net toggle button specifies whether to use the 
<A HREF="loccontext.html#net">Network</A> location provider
to monitor for this location 

<H5>GPS Button</H5>

The GPS toggle button specifies whether to use 
<A HREF="loccontext.html#gps">GPS</A>
 to monitor for this location
(assuming it is available on the device). If GPS is not used, the network will need
to be available in order to query for location fixes based on cell-towers or WiFi
data.
