</H2>

<P>
The scene editor is used for designing custom scenes.
</P>

The editor consists of three areas:

<H3>Display Area</H3>

The main part of the editor, where the position and size of elements are arranged.
The display area has two modes dependent on the setting of the magnifying glass icon in the corner.

<H4>Preview Mode</H4>

This mode shows the scene as it will appear when displayed.

<UL>
	<LI>Click-and-drag</B> on the <B>edge</B> of the scene to resize it
</UL>

<H4>Editing Mode</H4>

This mode is zoomed to make editing easier.

<UL>
	<LI><B>Long-click</B> on an <B>empty</B> area to create a new element positioned there
	<LI><B>Long-click</B> on an <B>element</B> to get options for the element
	<LI><B>Click</B> on an <B>element</B> to edit it.
	<LI><B>Click-and-drag</B> on the <B>centre</B> of an element to move it
	<LI><B>Click-and-drag</B> on the <B>edge</B> of an element to resize it
</UL>

<P>
When moving and resizing, the sides of elements are snapped to a grid to make alignment
easier. The grid size is unique to each scene and can be changed via <B>Menu / Grid Size</B>.
</P>

<H3>Tool Bar</H3>

<H4>Touch Mode</H4>

There are four touch modes which decide the effect of taps on the
display area. 

<I>Normal Mode</I> is described above. <I>Edit Mode</I> is the same as
<I>Normal Mode</I> except that all controls except the
Touch Mode selector are hidden to allow access to small controls along the scene edges. 
<I>Move Mode</I> is intended to make it easier to reposition elements. <I>Resize</I> mode
is for making resizing easier. 
<P>

<H4>Element Picker</H4>

<P>
Allows selection of an element by name. This is most useful when an element is
difficult to directly click on due to other elements or because it's very small.
</P>
<P>
Both short and long clicks on the element names behave the same as short and long
clicks on the element itself.
</P>

<H4>Undo</H4>

Allows undo of all operations, up to 20 steps in the past.

<H4>New Element</H4>

Create a new element in the <B>middle</B> of the scene. Useful if the scene is already
cluttered with a lot of elements so there is no free space.

<H3>Menu Options</H3>

<H4>Background Colour</H4>

A complex background can be set by long-tapping an element and specifying it as 
the <A HREF="#back">background element</A>. If a uniform colour is sufficient, it can also
be specified with this menu option.

<P>
However, there is a special case where it's a good idea to specify a background colour even
if you already have a background element. A scene is resized to fit the container
 into which it's placed, but in some cases (e.g. when it is shown as a full screen activity) there will be margins left on one
side of the container because the <I>aspect ration</I> of the scene
(the relative size of its width and height) of a scene is never changed. In such a
case, the margins are coloured with the background colour specified here.
</P>

<H3>Element Long-Click Options</H3>

<A NAME="back" />
<H4>Set Background</H4>

An element which is set as the scene background is resized to always fill the whole scene
and interferes less with selection of other elements. To reverse this, long-tap on it and
select <B>Set Foreground</B>.

<H4>Pin</H4>

When an element is positioned satisfactorily, it can be pinned to make it easier to
select and manipulate other elements. To reverse this, long-tap on it and select
<B>Unpin</B>.

<H4>Set Depth</H4>

Each element has a particular depth which is unique to it. Deeper elements are obscured
by shallower elements which overlap them.

<H3>Orientation</H3>

<P>
The geometry (<B>position</B> and <B>size</B>) of each element can be configured independently for
portrait and landscape display orientations by rotating the device to the desired
orientation in the editor.
</P>

<P>
If no geometry is configured for a particular orientation when the scene is displayed, Tasker will attempt to
fit the elements into the scene based on the geometry of the elements in the other orientation.
</P>
