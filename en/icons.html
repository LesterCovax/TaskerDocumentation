Tasker can use four categories of icons:

<A HREF="#app">Application</A>, 
<A HREF="#builtin">Built-In</A>, 
<A HREF="#ipack">Ipack</A>, 
<A HREF="#user">User-Installed</A>.

<P>
In some places it's also possible to use any image stored on local media as an icon.
</P>

<A NAME="app"></A>
<H4>Application Icons</H4>

These are taken from applications installed on the device.
<P>
Minor note: if the icon of the application changes, an update of previously created widgets/shortcuts can
be forced by creating a single widget with the new icon and then rebooting.
</P>

<A NAME="builtin"></A>
<H4>Built-In Icons</H4>

These come with Tasker and are kept in the device's memory.

<A NAME="ipack"></A>
<H4>Ipack Icon Sets</H4>

<A HREF="http://ipack.dinglisch.net">Ipack</A> is a free, open format for sharing of icon sets between Android applications.
Ipack icon sets can be either installed from <A HREF="http://market.android.com/search?q=ipack">Play Store</A> or from the <A HREF="http://ipack.dinglisch.net/download.html">Ipack website</A>. 
<P>
When setting an icon, you will notice an item labelled <I>Download More Icons</I>. Clicking on it will use the appropriate source depending on which version of Tasker you have.
</P>

<A NAME="user"></A>
<H4>User-Installed Icons</H4>

<P>
You can also install your own icons directly into Tasker's icon directory
<CODE>/sdcard/Tasker/.icn/</CODE>. Make sure the icons are in a subdirectory.
The subdirectory should also only be one level deep (no subsubdirectories).
</P>
<P>
Icons must be in PNG format.
</P>
<P>
Example: a two-icon set called <I>Christmas</I> would have the two files
in these locations:
