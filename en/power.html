	Power Usage
	<IMG style="float:right" SRC="icon_tasker.png"/>
</H2>

Internally, Tasker does its best to keep power usage down. Following are some macro-strategies to
achieve this.

<H4>Context Monitoring</H4>

<P>
When a profile contains multiple contexts, power is saved by only monitoring for changes in order of
the least-power-hungry first. For example, in a profile with a Time and App context, Tasker will not
decide that it needs to monitor for a changing application unless the Time context is active (because the
profile cannot become active until both contexts are active).
</P>

<P>Tasker rates contexts for power-hungriness in the following (ascending) order:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Other State
	<LI>Day / Time
	<LI>Calendar Entry State
	<LI>Cell Near State
	<LI>App
	<LI>BT Near State
	<LI>Network Location
	<LI>Wifi Near State
	<LI>GPS Location
	<LI>Temperature / Humidity / Proximity / Pressure / Magnetic Field / Light Sensor /  Gesture Event / Orientation State (accelerometer activation)
</UL>

<P>
Items at the bottom of the list won't become eligible for monitoring until all items further up the
list are active.
</P>

<H4>Display-Off Checks</H4>

When the display is off, all necessary 'active' checks (GPS/Net Location, Wifi Near, App) are done at
the same time so that the device is awake for as short a time as possible. See <I>Display Off Timings</I>
in <CODE>Menu / Prefs / Monitor</CODE> for the frequency and maximum duration of these checks.
