	Application Context

</H2>

<P>
An <I>Application Context</I> is activated when selected parts of one or more application are
running.
<P>
<P>
Important: in Android versions after (and including) L, app detection is much less accurate.
For some apps it may not work at all, for others it may activate and never deactivate.
</P>

<H4>Controls</H4>

<H5><I>App</I> button</H5>

When checked, indicates that the context will become active if any of the selected applications
is in the <I>foreground</I>, meaning it is currently being displayed to the user.

<H5><I>Services</I> button</H5>

When checked, indicates that the context will also become active if a service
associated with any of the selected applications is running.
<P>
Note that services other than the obvious ones may be running. For example,
the default Play Music app may have a download service running even when not playing
music at a particular time.</P>


<H5><I>Invert</I> button</H5>

When the context is <I>inverted</I>, it will become active when any
application <B>apart from</B> the selected ones is matched

<H5><I>All</I> button</H5>

Usually only applications are shown for selection which would usually be shown
in the launcher. The All button shows certain other launchable activities.

<P>This button in no way affects how the context behaves.</P>

<H4>Application Checking</H4>

<P>
When any profiles have application contexts specified, Tasker checks frequently
to see if one of those applications has been launched. The default is every
1.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
If you would like quicker response, or you suspect this is severely increasing
your battery usage, you can change this value in preferences
(select <CODE>Menu / Preferences / Monitor</CODE> from the main screen).
