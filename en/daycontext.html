</H2>

A <I>Day Context</I> allows specification of one or more months and/or days of the
week/month.

<H4>Month Specification</H4>

The months are listed at the top, any of which can be selected. Selecting <B>no</B>
month has the same meaning as selecting <B>every</B> month i.e. has no restriction
on when the profile will become active.

<H4>Day of Week/Month Specification</H4>

Days of the week (<I>Sunday, Monday</I> etc) and/or month (<I>1st, 9th</I> etc) can be selected
independently with the pulldown centre-right. This will initially be for Week Days if
there are any defined, otherwise Month Days.
<P>
Selecting <B>no</B> day has the same meaning as selecting <B>every</B> day.
</P>
<P>
If you select <b>both</b> days of the week <B>and</B> days of the month, it requires both
conditions to be fulfilled for the profile to become active 
e.g. selecting <I>Mon,Tue</I> and <I>11th</I> means the profile will become active when the
day is a <I>Mon</I> or <I>Tuesday</I> and <B>simultaneously</B> the <I>11th</I> day of the month.
</P>

<P>
If you are unsure if you have specified the day(s) you require, click the <B>Done</B>
button and you will see a verbal description at the top of the Profile Edit screen.
You can click on this to try again if it's not correct.
