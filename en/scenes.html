<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
A <I>scene</I> is a graphical user-interface consisting of a collection of <I>elements</I> to which tasks can be attached to be run when the user interacts with them e.g. by tapping them.
</P>

<P>
Tasker uses scenes for things like popup dialogs, menus and getting input from the
user but scenes can actually be displayed by the user whenever desired, meaning
they can be used for things like creating simple user-designed applications or showing extra controls over the top of (selected) existing applications.
</P>

<P>
Scenes are completely user-customisable via a drag-and-drop graphical <A HREF="activity_sceneedit.html">editor</A>.
</P>

<H3>Displaying Scenes</H3>

<H4>Actions: <CODE>Enter Key, HTML Popup, Lock, Menu, Popup, Popup Task Buttons</CODE> and 
<CODE>Variable Query</CODE></H4>

These actions use a <B>built-in scene</B> with the same name as their action.
After creating a task with such an action, the associated scene can be found
under the <B>Scenes</B> tab on the main Tasker screen. That scene can be edited so that
e.g. all <CODE>Popup</CODE> actions have the same style because they all use the same scene.
</P>

<P>The parameters specified in the action are applied to the scene before it
is show. For instance, if the scene has a <I>Title</I> element it will be
set to the title specified in the action and the scene resized appropriately.
</P>

<P>
It might be desirable to have a different style for e.g. some <CODE>Popup</CODE> actions, in which case:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>clone the built-in scene long-clicking on it in the <B>Scenes</B> tab 
<LI>edit the clone to change the contents
<LI>in a <CODE>Popup</CODE> action, specify that the cloned scene should be used
by clicking on the <B>Layout</B> parameter in the action edit screen.
</OL>
</P>

<H4>Scene Category Actions: <CODE>Create Scene, Show Scene, Hide Scene, Destroy Scene</CODE></H4>

These allow a completely free hand over when a scene should be displayed and it's
life-cycle. They all act on scenes pre-designed in the <B>Scenes</B> tab.

<P>
Usually, only <CODE>Show Scene</CODE> and <CODE>Destroy Scene</CODE> will be
used, however sometimes it's useful for a scene to be created but not visible to
the user:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>by hiding a scene instead of completely destroying it, the settings of the elements
are retained for next time it is shown
<LI>the values of the elements in the scene can be changed to track certain
events so that the scene can be immediately displayed when required without any
configuration
</UL>

<H3>Scene Elements</H3>

Each scene is comprised of a number of elements.

<P>
An element has three main components:

<H4>Geometry</H4>

It's size and position on the screen. An element's geometry is specified in 
the <A HREF="activity_sceneedit.html">scene editor</A>.

<H4>Content</H4>

How it looks on the screen. 

<P>
Specified under the <B>UI</B> tab in the element editor. Some
elements also have a Background tab. A Menu element has an additional Items tab.
<P>

<H4>Event Tasks</H4>

What should happen when the user interacts with the element.

<P>
Specified under the right-most tabs after clicking on the element in the element editor.
There are different events depending on the type of element. For instance, a Button has
tap and long-tap events while a Slider has a value-set event.
</P>

<P>Event tasks are run at priority one higher than the task which displayed the scene
</P>
<P>Local variables set by event tasks are visible to all tasks in the same scene.</P>

<H3>Scene Element Actions</H3>

In the <B>Scenes</B> action category, there are several actions for setting
the properties of scene elements. You can use these for a wide variety 
of purposes e.g.

<UL>
<LI>when a slider value is set, change the zoom of an associated map element
<LI>set the size of an element depending on current light level
<LI>animate elements around a scene
</UL>

<P>
Note that actions that affect scene elements can only be used when the scene has
already been created (via <CODE>Create Scene</CODE> or <CODE>Show Scene</CODE>).
The scene does not have to be visible.
</P>
